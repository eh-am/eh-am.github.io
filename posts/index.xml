Ou sobre enshittification. Ou Linux &amp;gt; Windows. Interprete como quiser.
Em resumo, tenho um desktop que praticamente tornei num Console: fica ligado na televisão, controle plugado, Steam inicializa sozinha em Big Picture Mode.
Claro, na maior parte do tempo o computador fica em hibernação.
Pra voltar da hibernação, aperto qualquer botão do controle. Inesperadamente o Windows reconhece e &amp;ldquo;acorda&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Banda da Vez: Pram</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/banda-da-vez-pram/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 11:52:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/banda-da-vez-pram/</guid><description>Apresento-vos a banda pram, ingleses que fazem um som meio etéreo, com influências de kraut, postrock e até dub.
Algumas músicas tem escaleta e outros instrumentos que soam &amp;ldquo;infantil&amp;rdquo;, na melhor interpretação da palavra.
Os melhores álbuns pra mim são:
North Pole Radio Station (1998) The Museum of Imaginary Animals (2000) Dark Island (2003) Que foi quando eles encontraram sua estética.

Como dizemos informalmente, agora &amp;ldquo;bateu&amp;rdquo;. Tendo a atribuir à maturidade, mas na realidade deve ser porque estou um pouco cansado de coisas high energy, como o rock.

Back in the day Brazil there were a few, like Tim Festival (previously Free Jazz), Planeta Terra etc. However I was too young and too poor to attend to any of them. When I loved in Toronto there was Osheaga, which my wife attended but I didn&amp;rsquo;t (we weren&amp;rsquo;t dating at the time). So when moving to Portugal we definitely wanted to attend a festival, specifically Primavera Sound, which is now a classic one.</description></item><item><title>Shellac Concert</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/shellac-concert/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:13:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/shellac-concert/</guid><description>Shellac is one of my favorites bands. It&amp;rsquo;s punk, noisy, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take itself too seriously etc. Every song I feel like &amp;ldquo;this is the kind of song I would want to do if I had a band again&amp;rdquo;.
The location was in a place called B.Leza, which a pun with Beleza, aka &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s near the pier, so a nice atmosphere!
The opening act was by the portuguese artist Puçanga, not really my cup of tea and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it had anything to do with Shellac, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t spoil the fun.</description></item><item><title>Swans Concert</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/swans-concert/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 18:44:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/swans-concert/</guid><description>We went to a Swans concert at Culturgest(28 euros each ticket). It&amp;rsquo;s walking distance from home, which is pretty convenient!
We got right on time for the opening, so most seats were occupied. They were reserved ones and we had trouble finding ours. For some reason here the numbers are on the back of the seats, so it&amp;rsquo;s kinda difficult to find yours. We got the second row, which in retrospect may be too close.</description></item><item><title>kkk, cá-cá, quiá quiá and きゃっきゃっ and some other coincidences in language</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/kya-kya/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 17:21:05 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/kya-kya/</guid><description>In my Japanese studies I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon the きゃっきゃっ (kya-kya) onomatopoeia, which represents playful, laughter of children.
In Brazilian Portuguese we usually laugh with KKK (which sometimes evokes fear in the Anglo word due the pointy hat association). It&amp;rsquo;s a corruption of &amp;ldquo;quá quá quá&amp;rdquo; used in comics, it came into shape in the 90s and 2000s with the Internet and its tendency to abbreviate things. Mostly (I believe) an influence from the English language and its many acronyms.</description></item><item><title>Formatting strings with %q in go</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/go-printf-q/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 17:21:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/go-printf-q/</guid><description>TIL you can use %d in Printf statements (and its friends, like Fatalf/Errorf) when printing strings/runes.
What it does is:
Escapes any special characters Add quotes around it (single if it&amp;rsquo;s a single rune) I really like how it adds quotes around the string. I&amp;rsquo;ve had innumerous times when a go program was supposed to printed something (mostly likely in errors), but since the string was empty, it didn&amp;rsquo;t print anything.</description></item><item><title>Maracas de Fogo by Lula Côrtes and Zé Ramalho</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/maracas-de-fogo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 12:22:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/maracas-de-fogo/</guid><description>A long time ago I was at a party (or a club, or a discotecagem before a show) and this incredible song started playing. I remember the floor was pretty empty, which baffled me since the playlist seemed pretty good.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t identify what it was, I asked my friends that raised their shoulders. I took the courage and asked the DJ. I immediately took notes, and saved the video on YouTube.</description></item><item><title>Review: Guardians of the Galaxy</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/review-guardians-of-the-galaxy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 23:44:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/review-guardians-of-the-galaxy/</guid><description>In preparation for the Guardians of the Galaxy 3, my SO and I watched the previous two movies (first time for her), then we went to the movies watch the third one.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that the I watched the 3 movies at completely different points of my life. It felt nostalgic.
The first movie is pretty solid, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to say that you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard it before.
The second one I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it when I first watched.</description></item><item><title>Review: Summer Time Rendering (Anime)</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/review-summer-time-rendering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 23:34:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/review-summer-time-rendering/</guid><description>Summer Time Rendering is a 2022 anime based on a manga of the same name. It was totally outside my radar, until Hideo Kojima recommended on twitter.
It starts really strong. There&amp;rsquo;s some some slice of life, mystery and even some terror. The plot is smart enough, although for the otakus some of its plot points may be not so original.
I liked that it passes in Tomogashima, Wakayama, although it has a different name.</description></item><item><title>Play youtube videos in the background in firefox (android)</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/youtube-videos-play-in-the-background/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 16:09:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/youtube-videos-play-in-the-background/</guid><description>Forget Youtube Vanced and NewPipe.

I found that a component, published to npm was crashingwhen giving a certain input.

These are my impressions.
To be fair, we almost didn&amp;rsquo;t go. Earlier in the day we went eat pastéis (salty, the brazilian flavor ones), then later we got a pizza. お腹が痛い。
The doors opened a 8pm. The opening band was scheduled to start at 9pm.

Its stack is pretty simple: a static website using hugo. Posts are created via Netlify CMS, which triggers a pipeline that builds the app and deploys to s3.
I noticed deploys were getting pretty slow. 5, 6, 7 minutes and sometimes even 8. It didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, since building locally is pretty fast, and pushing to s3 should be fast, since most files won&amp;rsquo;t change.</description></item><item><title>Review: Videodrome (1983)</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/review-videodrome/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 20:17:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/review-videodrome/</guid><description>Watched in a movie theater, thanks to CinePop. 4 Euros each ticket, cheap enough to watch a Cronenberg classic.

I don&amp;rsquo;t keep notes on why I wanted to watch them, or where I first learned about them. Most often, enough time passes that when I finally get to watch it, I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s it about. It ends up being a good strategy, since I get to see it with completely fresh eyes.
This week I got to watch Africa Addio (1996), or Africa: Blood and Guts.</description></item><item><title>Kill all commands that match a query</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/kill-all-commands-that-match/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 16:41:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/kill-all-commands-that-match/</guid><description>I often kill a bunch of processes with some command line incantation, like ps aux | grep $MY_QUERY | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs kill, which as you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty verbose.
I am ashamed of myself, but only recently I learned pkill has a -f flag that kills all commands (ie. the whole thing, not only the process name) that match a certain query.
We can even pair it with -i to make it case insensitive, and -l to print the PID of the affected process.</description></item><item><title>Easy release pipelines in Github with Release Please</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/easy-release-pipelines-in-github/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 11:11:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/easy-release-pipelines-in-github/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s this handy approach I use when releasing open source projects in Github that I would like to share.
The idea boils down to:
Using conventional commits to write commits in a semantic manner which can be used by tools Using Release Please to automatically create Pull Requests, which upon merge creates a Release with all the Changelog jazz. To enforce people will use conventional commits, there are couple things you need to do:</description></item><item><title>Acessing the host from a docker container</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/docker-host/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 11:04:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/docker-host/</guid><description>This is one of the things I wish I knew earlier.
When developing locally, sometimes you need a database, in those cases you can simply run docker/docker-compose, expose the port and hit that port from the development server.
When running tests, I like to use testcontainers to spin up a test db.
So host -&amp;gt; container communication is straightforward.
However, there are cases when I need to access the host from a container:</description></item><item><title>TIL: Ken Shimura invented the 'Saisho wa gu' from Janken</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/saisho-wa-gu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 15:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/saisho-wa-gu/</guid><description>TIL, the japanese comedian Ken Shimura was the first to invent/popularize the phrase you say/sing before playing janken (aka rock paper scissors, or jokempo in portuguese) in japanese.

But recently I&amp;rsquo;ve came across the structuredClone which does what&amp;rsquo;s expected. And the support seems okay, although core-js has a polyfill.

In Rocket League, the game I am mostly familiar with, the meta has changed from hitting the backboard, to bumping/demoing the opponent, ballchasing, flip resets etc.
Lately the term has taken a broad approach, referring to other things other than gaming, very similarly to the Brazilian Portuguese word &amp;ldquo;manha&amp;rdquo;, meaning ability to perform something, or quirk.</description></item><item><title>Review: O Natal do Bruno Aleixo</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/o-natal-do-bruno-aleixo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 17:40:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2023/o-natal-do-bruno-aleixo/</guid><description>Back in ~2008 Bruno Aleixo became famous in the underground Brazilian internet culture with its weird sketches that were streets ahead of what we knew.

1 L = λ * W Where L = average number of items in the queue λ = average rate of new items arriving in the queue W = average time spent in the queue</description></item><item><title>Pagination</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2022/pagination/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 16:28:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2022/pagination/</guid><description>I was looking into how to do proper pagination. I already knew about offset based pagination, normally used (among other places)in forums. It works as follows:
Each page has a fixed number of elements (eg 10), aka LIMIT in sql. When querying, you use, OFFSET to skip the first N elements. To calculate N you use current page - 1 * number of elements per page. If current page is 1, 0 * 10 is 0.</description></item><item><title>open tmux in a certain directory</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2022/open-tmux-in-certain-directory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2022/open-tmux-in-certain-directory/</guid><description>When I start working on a project, I start tmux and then cd into its directory.
