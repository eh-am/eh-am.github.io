I don&rsquo;t keep notes on why I wanted to watch them, or where I first learned about them.
Most often, enough time passes that when I finally get to watch it, I have no idea what&rsquo;s it about.
It ends up being a good strategy, since I get to see it with completely fresh eyes.</p><p>This week I got to watch Africa Addio (1996), or Africa: Blood and Guts.</p><p>Africa Addio is an Italian documentary about the effects of the end of the
European Colonial Era in Africa. Right at the beginning it sets its tone, saying that <strong>&ldquo;Europe has abandoned its baby when it needed the most&rdquo;</strong> or something like that, reverberating that adage that <strong>Europe made 2 mistakes in Africa: colonizing it, and then leaving it behind.</strong></p><p>Technically it&rsquo;s a pretty good movie, with a superb artsy photography that gets <strong>their</strong> point across.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one part where the English (I think) are selling their stuff to the new
African elites, where the narrator implies that the Africans don&rsquo;t know what to do with it, since
they are just mimicking the European elites. Which reminded me of Rene Girard&rsquo;s mimetic desire theory.</p><p>Speaking of Girard, the whole Scapegoat thing can also be seen as a motivation for the blame on the Colonialists (or &ldquo;whites&rdquo;).
Of course, without no doubt colonialism is/was bad. But it also reminded me of the Brazilian/Portuguese population using their politicians/immigrants/digital nomads as a scapegoat.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am Brazilian, with black AND indigenous ascendency, so I understand how the past affects us. However, there&rsquo;s a point we need to be more realistic and stop blaming everything on the past and start focusing on future. One common argument I often hear (and cringe) is that &ldquo;Brazil never had a chance because it was an exploitation colony, whereas the US was a colonization colony!&rdquo;. But I digress, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL9DsgRbUiI">Leitura ObrigaHISTÓRIA video if you are interested in learning why that&rsquo;s a bs argument</a>.</p><p>Back to the movie, although it managed to catch really interesting journalistic scenes, like the Arab massacre in Zanzibar, it sometimes feel like the timing is <strong>too good</strong> to be true, like when they got footage of the population killing hippos, elephants and other animals.
Which by the way is a pretty gruesome scene, be aware.</p><p>A somewhat funny part is when they are in Tanzania and get captured, and are only saved from
execution because &ldquo;They are not whites, they are Italians!&rdquo;.</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyLCd6_r0yU title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>But let&rsquo;s be real, <strong>this movie is incredibly racist</strong>, portraying Africans as savages, violent, superstitious, incapable of managing their own countries. That being said, if you can get past the propaganda, there&rsquo;s enough material to make you reflect for a long time.</p><p>My final review is <strong>I liked it, but would not watch again</strong>. I don&rsquo;t recommend it for the non-mature audience, more susceptible to propaganda. I don&rsquo;t want to lose more friends to the alt-right :)</p><p>There&rsquo;s some versions floating on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fm464VmtPc">Youtube</a> if you want to watch it.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2020 - 2023
