As you may be aware, I have a music podcast called [Triceratops Show](www.triceratops.show).

Since I had to setup my recording environment again in a mac, I decided to document it here.

For recording I basically use OBS.

The trick is to record both my microphone and the computer audio as 2 separate tracks,
so that we can sync them later.

Turns out that's not as easy as I would hope.


Had to install Blackhole. Here's a [tutorial explanining how to set it up](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/mac-desktop-audio-using-blackhole.1191/), but it basically will capture the audio but still route it to you (so that you can listening to your desktop audio).

Then in OBS we need to record desktop audio/microphone as 2 separate tracks:

And that should be it.
