I've been playing Pokemon Violet in japanese. It's definitely challenging to both my japanese skills and my patience. I frequently skip text messages, making me miss some important info. On the other hand, it makes me feel like a child again, learning new things one at a time.

But anyway, here are a few useful links:

# Type chart

As a 90s child, I've played pokemon. I remember most of the counters, but some of them I do not (eg. why is poison strong against fairy?). So this comes handy.

# List of pokemon names in japanese/english
I often have to refer to [bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) page of an specific pokemon, but I first need to know its name!

With this list I can easily find (ctrl+f) by the japanese name.

# List of movesets in japanese
Similarly, when a new move shows up, I need to know how good that is. Most times I can try and translate its description, but it's also improtant to know the name in english, specially when talking with other people (ie my SO).
