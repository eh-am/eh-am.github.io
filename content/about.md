My name is Eduardo Aleixo! I am originally from the country side Sao Paulo, now living in the capital (also named Sao Paulo). Still adapting to the big city.
I currently do remote work for [Translucent Computing](https://www.translucentcomputing.com/), it's been lots of fun there!

You can contact me at [eduardo@eduardoaleixo.com](mailto:eduardo@eduardoaleixo.com)

I'm (at the moment) interested professionally in:

- programming/operations/devops (i am a firmly believer of the devops culture)
- kubernetes (it's complex but we can do amazing things with it) and its ecossystem (containers, distributed systems, observability, stateless workloads)
- functional programming, static typing
- elm, haskell, elixir
- linux

What I am currently doing at work is:

- kubernetes (raw yaml, helm charts)
- groovy (jenkins pipeline)
- typescript (internal nodejs tooling and some angular)
- golang (internal tooling)
- prometheus (intrumentation)
- grafana dashboards
- some bash
- ci/cd with jenkins/spinnaker
- infrastructure as code (terraform/ansible)

My personal interests revolve around:

- iberic culture (spanish language, southern cone politics, etc)
- japanese culture (writing system, enka music, bit of manga)
- gaming (rocket league, ryu ga gotoku series)
- music, mainly alternative rock 80~00s (take sonic youth as the prime example)

I am trying to get more into (as of 2020):

- cooking
- japanese language
- non-technical reading (comics, manga, novels)
- movies
