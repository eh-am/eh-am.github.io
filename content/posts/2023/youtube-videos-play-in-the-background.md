Forget Youtube Vanced and NewPipe. Just use firefox + ublock. It used to work out of the box,
but it [apparently broke recently](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1827583).

In any case, just install the "Video Background Play Fix" addon. Notice that you
have to install via the builtin firefox addon list, if you open the webpage it will just download
a `xpi` file.
