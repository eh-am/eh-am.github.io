In preparation for the Guardians of the Galaxy 3, my SO and I watched the previous two movies (first time for her), then we went to the movies watch the third one.

It's interesting that the I watched the 3 movies at completely different points of my life. It felt nostalgic.

The first movie is pretty solid, there's nothing to say that you haven't heard it before.

The second one I didn't like it when I first watched. I found the parts with Kurt Russell boring. This time I got to understand it more. The whole relationship with Yondu, who's Starlord real father etc.

The third one was also solid. It made it clear that Rocket Raccoon (now we can finally call him that!) is the protagonist in a deeper analysis. I absolutely loved bringing the High Evolutionary and Counter Earth, since that was the plot of Spider-Man Unlimited, a cartoon I really liked back in the day.

Talking with friends they said it reminded them of WE3, a cool (and short) Grant Morrisson comic. I personally didn't get that vibe so much, but I will leave the recommendation.

One thing these movies do really well is to capture the "Comic Book" feeling. New characters are added to the team (just like a shonen). The worlds are completely illogical but fun.

To be honest I didn't remember much of the Infinity Wars neither watched the Christmas Special, so that was a little detrimental to my understanding of the status quo, like the whole Gamora situation, or how they were reconstructing Knowhere. But the movie did well enough to explain without explaining too much.

I think I got to understand better the whole family/friendship thing, dealing with loss etc better this time.

After that we watched the Christmas Special, which is just like you expect. I should've watched before the third one, of course.

James Gunn is honestly, "one of us". He understands what the original material is about, and knows how to speak to us and a more general audience. I am really glad someone like him exists, and is given enough power. I am really looking forward to his DCU, although I feel bad since people are a bit fatigued of the whole Super Heroes thing.

Anyway, I really liked the 3 movies, I think they are part of me, and I definitely want to watch them again.
