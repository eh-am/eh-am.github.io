My name is Eduardo Aleixo! I am originally from the country side Sao Paulo, now living in the capital (also named Sao Paulo). Still adapting to the big city.
I currently do remote work for [Translucent Computing](https://www.translucentcomputing.com/), it's been lots of fun there!

I'm (currently) interested professionally in:

- programming/operations/devops (i am a firmly believer of the devops culture)
- kubernetes (it's complex but we can do amazing things with it) and its ecossystem (containers, distributed systems, observability, stateless workloads)
- functional programming, static typing etc
- user experience (i like pretty, simple and useful design)

My personal interests revolve around:

- iberic culture (spanish language, southern cone politics, etc)
- japanese culture (writing system, enka music, bit of manga)
- gaming (rocket league, ryu ga gotoku series)
- music, mainly alternative rock 80~00s (take sonic youth as the prime example)

I am trying to get more into (as of 2020):

- cooking (a new world has opened to me since my girlfriend introduced me to traditional japanese dishes)
- japanese language
- karaoke
- non-technical reading (comics, manga, novels)
- movies
