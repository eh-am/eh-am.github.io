I always thought it was a crappy movie due to its subtitle in Brazil: &ldquo;Os Federais&rdquo;, ie &ldquo;The Federals&rdquo;. It was surprisingly a good movie! I mean, it went into the category &ldquo;I liked it, but wouldn&rsquo;t watch again&rdquo; which to me is a win. Also it was a perfect movie for a lazy Saturday.</p><p>I liked Wesley Snipes there, there was an young Robert Downey Jr. (remember him before becoming Iron Man? I didn&rsquo;t). But the one that stolen the scene was Tommy Lee Jones.</p><p>Looking up on Wikipedia I found that it was kinda of a sequel of another movie, <strong>The Fugitive (1993)</strong>, starring Harrison Ford and TLJ (which even got a Supporting Actor Oscar for it!). It was based on a TV series from the 60s which I assumed was never aired in Brazil so I knew nothing about it.</p><p>Anyway, you can google up the synopsis, but basically TLJ and his gang of US Marshals have to pursue Harrison Ford, which was allegedly wrongly convicted to capital punishment!</p><p>The scene where he scapes prison in the beginning is very interesting and definitely holds your attention. <a href="https://www.strangecarolinas.com/2017/06/the-fugitive-train-wreck-sylva-nc.html?m=0">BTW the wreckage was still there</a> until recently!</p><p>Another cool scene is when he jumps off a cliff on a dam. I wonder if that was the film that created this trope, which is also pictured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VDvRLfShes">Metal Gear Solid 3</a>. I bet Kojima has also watched this movie!</p><p>I already talked about Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, but there&rsquo;s also an young Julianne More there. Plus there&rsquo;s Joe Pantoliano, which you may remember as Cypher from The Matrix.</p><p><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYzM2E4OGQtOTEyNS00MDMyLTg2NjQtODE1NTIxODRhYjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MzA5NQ@@._V1_.jpg alt="Joe Pantoliano"></p><p>Ah, another thing I spotted is the actor Neil Flynn, which is mostly known as &ldquo;The Janitor&rdquo; from Scrubs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-HRR_EPVew">Which they reference in an episode.</a></p><p><img src=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/scrubs/images/9/9b/3x8_Janitor_acts.jpg alt="Neil Flynn in Scrubs referencing The Fugitive"></p><p>My final review is&mldr;liked it, but wouldn&rsquo;t watch again. It&rsquo;s definitely better than US Marshals. Which is not a bad thing.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2020 - 2023
