The other day we caught the movie US Marshals on TV. I always thought it was a crappy movie due to its subtitle in Brazil: "Os Federais", ie "The Federals". It was surprisingly a good movie! I mean, it went into the category "I liked it, but wouldn't watch again" which to me is a win. Also it was a perfect movie for a lazy Saturday.

I liked Wesley Snipes there, there was an young Robert Downey Jr. (remember him before becoming Iron Man? I didn't). But the one that stolen the scene was Tommy Lee Jones.

Looking up on Wikipedia I found that it was kinda of a sequel of another movie, **The Fugitive (1993)**, starring Harrison Ford and TLJ (which even got a Supporting Actor Oscar for it!). It was based on a TV series from the 60s which I assumed was never aired in Brazil so I knew nothing about it.

Anyway, you can google up the synopsis, but basically TLJ and his gang of US Marshals have to pursue Harrison Ford, which was allegedly wrongly convicted to capital punishment!

The scene where he scapes prison in the beginning is very interesting and definitely holds your attention. [BTW the wreckage was still there](https://www.strangecarolinas.com/2017/06/the-fugitive-train-wreck-sylva-nc.html?m=0) until recently!

Another cool scene is when he jumps off a cliff on a dam. I wonder if that was the film that created this trope, which is also pictured in [Metal Gear Solid 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VDvRLfShes). I bet Kojima has also watched this movie!

I already talked about Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, but there's also an young Julianne More there. Plus there's Joe Pantoliano, which you may remember as Cypher from The Matrix.

Ah, another thing I spotted is the actor Neil Flynn, which is mostly known as "The Janitor" from Scrubs. [Which they reference in an episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-HRR_EPVew)

My final review is...liked it, but wouldn't watch again. It's definitely better than US Marshals. Which is not a bad thing.
