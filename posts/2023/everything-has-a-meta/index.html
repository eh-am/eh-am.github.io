In Rocket League, the game I am mostly familiar with, the meta has changed from hitting the backboard, to bumping/demoing the opponent, ballchasing, flip resets etc.</p><p>Lately the term has taken a broad approach, referring to other things other than gaming, very similarly to the Brazilian Portuguese word &ldquo;manha&rdquo;, meaning ability to perform something, or quirk.</p><p>For example, when using someone&rsquo;s else shower, it&rsquo;s common to ask &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this shower&rsquo;s manha?&rdquo;. Sometimes you need to leave it very hot then slowly turning it down, sometimes you need to start cold and increasingly adding cold water etc.</p><p>The same applies for vehicles. One time I got my motorcycle stolen, but then the police found it later, most likely because the robbers couldn&rsquo;t turn it on again. This happened because my motorcycle had a manha, a quirk, or a <strong>meta</strong>.</p><p>Back in Pinheiros, where I lived in Brazil, the <strong>meta</strong> for a Saturday night was to eat empanadas then drink in a cocktail bar next to it. The reason is that empanadas were relatively cheap, but the beverages weren&rsquo;t that much.</p><p>Here in Portugal, and in Argentina too, the meta for dinner is arriving early, since it gets crowded staring ~9PM, and you won&rsquo;t get too much attention, or even a table. Specially being an immigrant.</p><p>Those things are things that you just learn by experimenting, trying to optimize the outcomes. Knowing which neighborhoods are good, which food is best on which restaurant etc.</p><p>One of my dream projects is to just build a universal catalogue of the <strong>meta</strong>. People would post their own tips there, grouped by category and location, and people would upvote the best ones.</p><p>The overall point is that every single are has its own <strong>meta</strong>. Each home appliance. Each website. Even each person you know. You gotta keep tabs on that, after all, you don&rsquo;t want to get behind the meta, right?</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2020 - 2025
