Then I got a mac for work.
To be fair, I &amp;gt;asked&amp;lt; for a mac because I wanted to experiment the whole arm hype. Spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s quite good indeed. Worth it disrupting an existing flow? Don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.
But anyway, I had a whole setup in linux that I had to adapt to this new machine. Some of it it&amp;rsquo;s just second-system syndrome (like keeping track of installed tools), some of it are indeed things I had to adapt.</description></item></channel></rss>
