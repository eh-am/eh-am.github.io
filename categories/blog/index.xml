Did you know you could do the following?
1 kubectl get pods -l &amp;#39;tier in (backend, frontend)&amp;#39; We at $WORK did not.
It's actually even more powerful, you can use notin, you can combine with , to perform AND. I recommend reading the docs for more examples.
Also, if you are at the exploration phase, don't forget to pass --show-labels to have a understanding of the existing labels.</description></item><item><title>my setup: ipad as a second monitor for quick note taking</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/ipad-second-monitor-note-taking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/ipad-second-monitor-note-taking/</guid><description>the situation i have an old Ipad 2 (2011 model), stuck at 9.3.5 version. its screen is kinda broken, but still usable. almost no apps can be installed. it's slow. my window manager is i3. i also started using vimwiki for note taking. i set it up as a scratchpad* to be able to take notes quickly. * in i3, a scratchpad it's simply a window that does not abide to the tiling rules.</description></item><item><title>Mocking endpoints granularly in Angular</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/angular-mock-endpoint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/angular-mock-endpoint/</guid><description>Introduction At $WORK the frontend team usually develops against the real backend (exposed internally), since running the backend locally involves some additional setup (and resources, such as RAM).
The normal flows goes as follows:
Backend developers start implementing the feature Frontend devs start working on the feature only after the backend is finished Which works fine most of the time. However, sometimes a feature is being developed in parallel, so the frontend crew doesn't have an API to code against!</description></item><item><title>Unnoficial Bash Strict Mode</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/bash-strict-mode/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/bash-strict-mode/</guid><description>Bash (and shell scripting in general) is NOT straightforward. It's easy to mess up if you don't know what you are doing. If you come from a traditional programming background and just want to plumb a few lines of code, there are a few behaviours that will confuse the hell out of you.
To help with that, the unnoficial bash strict mode was created. In this post, we will go over misleading behaviors and how the strict mode can be helpful in each case (quirks included).</description></item></channel></rss>
