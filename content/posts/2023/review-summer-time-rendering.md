Summer Time Rendering is a 2022 anime based on a manga of the same name. It was
totally outside my radar, until [Hideo Kojima recommended on twitter](https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1653918583846760448).

It starts really strong. There's some some slice of life, mystery and even some terror.
The plot is smart enough, although for the otakus some of its plot points may be
not so original.

I liked that it passes in Tomogashima, Wakayama, although it has a different name.
Since I've watched Tora-san in Goto I was somewhat familiar with how living in
a small island like that is like.

In the final arc(s) it gets a bit convoluted, it starts to become a more classic shonen
with the same old fights (aka "shonen de lutinha"). But it never gets boring.

I am glad I watched it, and hope some time in the future to watch it again.
