Then I got a mac for work.
To be fair, I &amp;gt;asked&amp;lt; for a mac because I wanted to experiment the whole arm hype. Spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s quite good indeed. Worth it disrupting an existing flow? Don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.
But anyway, I had a whole setup in linux that I had to adapt to this new machine. Some of it it&amp;rsquo;s just second-system syndrome (like keeping track of installed tools), some of it are indeed things I had to adapt.</description></item><item><title>picture-in-picture in i3</title><link>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2022/picture-in-picture-i3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eduardoaleixo.com/posts/2022/picture-in-picture-i3/</guid><description>intro Sometimes I want to make an arbitrary window to be &amp;ldquo;picture-in-picture&amp;rdquo;, ie for that window to be above all others, without affecting their layout.
And most importantly, I also want that behaviour to be consistent across workspaces.
A prime example of that is zoom calls, where I may jump between workspaces while we are talking about different subjects.
meat Luckily i3 supports that well quite easily by using sticky floating windows.</description></item></channel></rss>
