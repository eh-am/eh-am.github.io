title: Creating a layout on Photoshop for the very first time
category: project
---

Last term I took a course on [Design of Interactive Computacional Media](http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/crs_csc.htm#CSC318H1), which I really liked.
Our last assignment was to design a layout for a fictional company, based on the following wireframe:

Then we had to justify the color scheme, typefaces etc.

Here's my design:

And my justificative:


>The Company

>Nimbus is an online clothing store focused on Fall and Winter clothes. Their main target is
stylish young adults, especially those who live in metropolitan areas. Those people usually
feel confident, creative, unique and tuned with the newest style tendencies.


>Design Decisions

>For Nimbus, my company, I selected a minimalist approach for the branding. The color
scheme is white and black, which brings a sense of modern (in reality, I have used a grey
tone instead of black, to decrease the black and white contrast). There is also a good use of
white space so that users do not feel confused by a great amount of elements in the page.
The typography is based on two typefaces: Josefin Sans and Helvetica Neue. Josefin Sans
is the main typeface used. As a Geometric Sans font, it brings a sense of futuristic and
minimalist, which fits the main target’s style. For the less important parts, such as the search
bar and the “More info” button, I have used Helvetica Neue, which is a safe choice, as I did
not want to use another prominent typeface, which could collide with Josefin Sans.
For the logo, I used Josefin Sans with a light weight. I also added a drop shadow effect, to
highlight it from the background.

>As the company focus on Fall and Winter, I have used Winter themed pictures. For the
Spotlight image, a picture of a young woman using a Winter Jacket in a snowy place. She is
turned to the right, which leads the user to read the sale statement. All the pictures are
colored, to give contrast from the monochromatic theme. For the Featured Products, I
chosed to show a Fur Jacket and Fall Boots, to show that the store sell products from both
Fall and Winter.


I got a 68.80/80, mostly because of the logo (I admit, I wasn't creative).

Anyway, this was my first time making layouts using Photoshop. It's nice to put yourself in other person's place, I feel that after this exercise I understand better my fellows designers.
