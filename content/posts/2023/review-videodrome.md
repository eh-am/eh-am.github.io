Watched in a movie theater, thanks to [CinePop](https://www.cinepop.pt/). 4 Euros each ticket, cheap enough to watch a Cronenberg classic.

I haven't thought enough about this, so I will just dump a bunch of unconnected thoughts. Nothing very different from my usual posts.

* Replace TV for Internet and it still works
* Late night TV soft porn
* Snuff films
* Gore, who watches that and why?
* James Woods is manipulated by the Media
* Pirate radio/TV
  * Still happened in the 90s
* Baudrillard's Simulacra & Simulation
* Serial Experiments Lain
* eXistenZ
* VTubers and Internet nicknames
  * "Soon, all of us will have special names"
* Total Recall vibes
  * Specially the special effects, obviously enough
* Conservatives using the exact same methods they criticize
* Marshall McLuhan's "The media is the message"
  * Watching in the theaters is definitely different from watching from home
* Debbie Harry
  * She is pretty in this film, but she reminds me someone else
* The Ring/Ringu
  * "Forbidden tape"
* Does media make us violent?
  * Carmageddon ban in Brazil


I liked it and would (**need to**) watch it again.
